> #### Hello World! Welcome to my new blog infrastructure, I made it to move away from Medium and I hope this helps other people have their own independent blog!

# How to clone this blog

1. Go to https://github.com/MarcoWorms/blog and create a github account if you don't have one
   
2. Click "Use this template" -> "Create new repository"

3. Enter a repository name like `blog`. Also select "include all branches".

4. Go to "Settings" in your repository and enable write permission for actions (they will fail on creation because they don't have this permission):

5. Go to "Actions" in your repository, select the failed action, click "Re-Run jobs":

6. Done! When all actions are done running your blog is now up and deploying every change in the `main` github branch at `https://your_github_username.github.io/your_repo_name`

7. (optional) I've added all themes commented in the quarto config file so you can easily switch themes and try them out! Check this file: https://github.com/MarcoWorms/blog/blob/main/_quarto.yml

# How to preview site/post locally

To preview posts and the blog locally install quarto and the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension:

- Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
- VSCode Extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto

You don't need to do this step, but it's much easier to preview your posts and themes! You can split screen markdown and the post preview like this:

# How to write new posts

1. Delete all posts from `/posts` folder, maybe leave one as template
2. Create a folder (which will be used in the post url) and add a `index.qmd` file 
3. Add author, title, date, and categories in the first lines of `index.qmd`:

1. Use Markdown to write your post, if you need help with markdown check https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html
2. Commit changes in `/posts` to your repository `main` branch and wait for actions to deploy!

Quarto supports Jupyter Notebooks, you can check how to do this here: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html

# How to use social mentions

You can use mentions from gits, youtube, vimeo, loom, twitter, and mastodon, just add them like this in your post:


- `{{<\ gist USERNAME GIST_ID >}}`
- `{{<\ youtube VIDEO_ID >}}`
- `{{<\ vimeo VIDEO_ID >}}`
- `{{<\ loom VIDEO_ID >}}`
- `{{<\ tweet USERNAME TWEET_ID >}}`
- `{{<\ mastodon STATUS_URL >}}`

# What is missing?

I still have to figure out the mechanic for people to add their email to a list that receives notifications for new posts, I don't miss much this feature but it would make the structure more professional.
